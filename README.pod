=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module takes a data reference (or two) and 
L<recursivly|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)> 
travels through it(them).  Where the two references diverge the walker follows the 
primary data reference.  At the L<beginning|/Assess and implement the before_method> 
and L<end|/Assess and implement the after_method> of each branch or L<node|/node> 
in the data the code will attempt to call a L<method|/Extending Data::Walk::Extracted> 
on the remaining unparsed data.

=head2 Acknowledgement of MJD

This is an implementation of the concept of extracted data walking from 
L<Higher-Order-Perl|http://hop.perl.plover.com/book/> Chapter 1 by 
L<Mark Jason Dominus|https://metacpan.org/author/MJD>.  I<The book is well worth the 
money!>  With that said I diverged from MJD purity in two ways. This is object oriented 
code not functional code. Second, when taking action the code will search for class 
methods provided by (your) role rather than acting on passed closures.  There is clearly 
some overhead associated with both of these differences.  I made those choices consciously 
and if that upsets you L<do not hassle MJD|/AUTHOR>!

=head2 What is the unique value of this module?

With the recursive part of data walking extracted the various functionalities desired 
when walking the data can be modularized without copying this code.  The Moose 
framework also allows diverse and targeted data parsing without dragging along a 
L<kitchen sink|http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/everything_but_the_kitchen_sink> API 
for every use of this class.

=head2 Extending Data::Walk::Extracted

B<All action taken during the data walking must be initiated by implementation of action 
methods that do not exist in this class>.  It usually also makes sense to build an 
initial action method as well.  The initial action method can do any data-preprocessing 
that is useful as well as providing the necessary set up for the generic walker.  All 
of these elements can be combined with this class using a L<Moose role
|https://metacpan.org/module/Moose::Manual::Roles>, by 
L<extending the class|https://metacpan.org/module/Moose::Manual::Classes>, or it can be 
joined to the class at run time. See L<MooseX::ShortCut::BuildInstance
|https://metacpan.org/module/MooseX::ShortCut::BuildInstance>.  or L<Moose::Util
|https://metacpan.org/module/Moose::Util> for more class building information.  See the 
L<parsing flow|/Recursive Parsing Flow> to understand the details of how the methods are 
used.  See L<methods used to write roles|/Methods used to write roles> for the available 
methods to implement the roles.

Then, L<Write some tests for your role!|http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=918837>

=head1 Recursive Parsing Flow

=head2 Initial data input and scrubbing

The primary input method added to this class for external use is refered to as 
the 'action' method (ex. 'mangle_data').  This action method needs to receive 
data and organize it for sending to the L<start method
|/_process_the_data( $passed_ref, $conversion_ref )> for the generic data walker.  
I<Remember if more than one role is added to Data::Walk::Extracted 
for a given instance then all methods should be named with consideration for other 
(future?) method names.  The '$conversion_ref' allows for muliple uses of the core 
data walkers generic functions.  The $conversion_ref is not passed deeper into the 
recursion flow.> 

=head2 Assess and implement the before_method

The class next checks for an available 'before_method'.  Using the test; 

	exists $passed_ref->{before_method};

If the test passes then the next sequence is run.

	$method = $passed_ref->{before_method};
	$passed_ref = $self->$method( $passed_ref );

If the $passed_ref is modified by the 'before_method' then the recursive parser will 
parse the new ref and not the old one.  The before_method can set;

	$passed_ref->{skip} = 'YES'
	
Then the flow checks for the need to investigate deeper.

=head2 Test for deeper investigation

The code now checks if deeper investigation is required checking both that the 'skip' key 
= 'YES' in the $passed_ref or if the node is a L<base ref type|/base node type>.  
If either case is true the process jumps to the L<after method
|/Assess and implement the after_method> otherwise it begins to investigate the next 
level.

=head2 Identify node elements

If the next level in is not skipped then a list is generated for all L<paths|/node> 
in the node. For example a 'HASH' node would generate a list of hash keys for that node.  
SCALAR nodes will generate a list with only one element containing the scalar contents.  
UNDEF nodes will generate an empty list.  

=head2 Sort the node as required

If the list L<should be sorted|/sorted_nodes> 
then the list is sorted. B<ARRAYS are hard sorted.> I<This means that the actual items in 
the (primary) passed data ref are permanantly sorted.>

=head2 Process each element

For each identified element of the node a new $data_ref is generated containing data that 
represents just that sub element.  The secondary_ref is only constructed if it has a 
matching type and element to the primary ref.  Matching for hashrefs is done by key 
matching only.  Matching for arrayrefs is done by position exists testing only.  I<No 
position content compare is done!> Scalars are matched on content.  The list of items 
generated for this element is as follows;

=over

B<before_method =E<gt>> --E<gt>name of before method for this role hereE<lt>--

B<after_method =E<gt>> --E<gt>name of after method for this role hereE<lt>--

B<primary_ref =E<gt>> the piece of the primary data ref below this element

B<primary_type =E<gt>> the lower primary (walker) 
L<ref type|/_extracted_ref_type( $test_ref )>

B<match =E<gt>> YES|NO (This indicates if the secondary ref meets matching critera

B<skip =E<gt>> YES|NO Checks L<the three skip attributes|/skipped_nodes> against 
the lower primary_ref node.  This can also be set in the 'before_method' upon arrival 
at that node.

B<secondary_ref =E<gt>> if match eq 'YES' then built like the primary ref

B<secondary_type =E<gt>> if match eq 'YES' then calculated like the primary type

B<branch_ref =E<gt>> L<stack trace|/A position trace is generated>

=back

=head2 A position trace is generated

The current node list position is then documented and pushed onto the array at 
$passed_ref->{branch_ref}.  The array reference stored in branch_ref can be 
thought of as the stack trace that documents the node elements directly between the 
current position and the initial (or zeroth) level of the parsed primary data_ref.  
Past completed branches and future pending branches are not maintained.  Each element 
of the branch_ref contains four positions used to describe the node and selections 
used to traverse that node level.  The values in each sub position are; 

	[
		ref_type, #The node reference type
		the list item value or '' for ARRAYs,
			#key name for hashes, scalar value for scalars
		element sequence position (from 0),
			#For hashes this is only relevent if sort_HASH is called
		level of the node (from 0),
			`#The zeroth level is the initial data ref
	]

=head2 Going deeper in the data

The down level ref is then passed as a new data set to be parsed and it starts 
at the L<before_method|/Assess and implement the before_method> again.

=head2 Actions on return from recursion

When the values are returned from the recursion call the last branch_ref element is 
L<pop|http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/pop.html>ed off and the returned data ref 
is used to L<replace|/fixed_primary> the sub elements of the primary_ref and secondary_ref 
associated with that list element in the current level of the $passed_ref.  If there are 
still pending items in the node element list then the program L<processes them too
|/Process each element>


=head2 Assess and implement the after_method

After the node elements have all been processed the class checks for an available 
'after_method' using the test;

	exists $passed_ref->{after_method};

If the test passes then the following sequence is run.

	$method = $passed_ref->{after_method};
	$passed_ref = $self->$method( $passed_ref );

If the $passed_ref is modified by the 'after_method' then the recursive parser will 
parse the new ref and not the old one.

=head2 Go up

The updated $passed_ref is passed back up to the L<next level
|/Actions on return from recursion>.

=head1 Attributes

Data passed to -E<gt>new when creating an instance.  For modification of these attributes 
see L<Public Methods|/Public Methods>.  The -E<gt>new function will either accept fat 
comma lists or a complete hash ref that has the possible attributes as the top keys.  
Additionally some attributes that have the following prefixed methods; get_$name, set_$name, 
clear_$name, and has_$name can be passed to L<_process_the_data
|/_process_the_data( $passed_ref, $conversion_ref )> and will be adjusted for just the 
run of that method call.  These are called L<one shot|/Supported one shot attributes> 
attributes.  Nested calls to _process_the_data will be tracked and the attribute will 
remain in force until the parser returns to the calling 'one shot' level.  Previous 
attribute values are restored after the 'one shot' attribute value expires.

=head2 sorted_nodes

=over

B<Definition:> If the primary_type of the L<$element_ref|/Process each element> 
is a key in this attribute hash ref then the node L<list|/Identify node elements> is 
sorted. If the value of that key is a CODEREF then the sort L<sort
|http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/sort.html> function will called as follows.

	@node_list = sort $coderef @node_list

I<For the type 'ARRAY' the node is sorted (permanantly) by the element values.  This 
means that if the array contains a list of references it will effectivly sort against 
the ASCII of the memory pointers.  Additionally the 'secondary_ref' node is not 
sorted, so prior alignment may break.  In general ARRAY sorts are not recommended.>

B<Default> {} #Nothing is sorted

B<Range> This accepts a HashRef.

B<Example:>

	sorted_nodes =>{
		ARRAY	=> 1,#Will sort the primary_ref only
		HASH	=> sub{	$b cmp $a }, #reverse sort the keys
	}
	
=back

=head2 skipped_nodes

=over

B<Definition:> If the primary_type of the L<$element_ref|/Process each element> 
is a key in this attribute hash ref then the 'before_method' and 'after_method' are 
run at that node but no L<parsing|/Identify node elements> is done.

B<Default> {} #Nothing is skipped

B<Range> This accepts a HashRef.

B<Example:>

	sorted_nodes =>{
		OBJECT => 1,#skips all object nodes
	}
    
=back

=head2 skip_level

=over

B<Definition:> This attribute is set to skip (or not) node parsing at the set level.  
Because the process doesn't start checking until after it enters the data ref 
it effectivly ignores a skip_level set to 0 (The base node level).  I<The test checks 
against the value in last position of the prior L<trace|/A position trace is generated> 
array ref + 1>.

B<Default> undef = Nothing is skipped

B<Range> This accepts an integer
    
=back

=head2 skip_node_tests

=over

B<Definition:> This attribute contains a list of test conditions used to skip 
certain targeted nodes.  The test can target an array position, match a hash key, even 
restrict the test to only one level.  The test is run against the latest 
L<branch_ref|/A position trace is generated> element so it skips the node below the 
matching conditions not the node at the matching conditions.  Matching is done with 
'=~' and so will accept a regex or a string.  The attribute contains an ArrayRef of 
ArrayRefs.  Each sub_ref contains the following;

=over

B<$type> - This is any of the L<identified|/_extracted_ref_type( $test_ref )> 
reference node types

B<$key> - This is either a scalar or regex to use for matching a hash key

B<$position> - This is used to match an array position.  It can be an integer or 'ANY'

B<$level> - This restricts the skipping test usage to a specific level only or 'ANY'

=back
    
B<Example:>
	
	[ 
		[ 'HASH', 'KeyWord', 'ANY', 'ANY'], 
		# Skip the node below the value of any hash key eq 'Keyword'
		[ 'ARRAY', 'ANY', '3', '4'], ], 
		# Skip the node stored in arrays at position three on level four
	]

B<Range> An infinite number of skip tests added to an array

B<Default> [] = no nodes are skipped

=back

=head2 change_array_size

=over

B<Definition:> This attribute will not be used by this class directly.  However 
the L<Data::Walk::Prune|https://metacpan.org/module/Data::Walk::Prune#prune_data-args> 
role may share it with other roles in the future so it is placed here so there will be 
no conflicts.  This is usually used to define whether an array size shinks when an element 
is removed.

B<Default> 1 (This probably means that the array will shrink when a position is removed)

B<Range> Boolean values.

=back

=head2 fixed_primary

=over

B<Definition:> This means that no changes made at lower levels will be passed 
upwards into the final ref.

B<Default> 0 = The primary ref is not fixed (and can be changed) I<0 -E<gt> effectively 
deep clones the portions of the primary ref that are traversed.>

B<Range> Boolean values.

=back

=head1 Methods

=head2 Methods used to write roles

These are methods that are not meant to be exposed to the final user of a composed role and 
class but are used by the role to excersize the class.

=head3 _process_the_data( $passed_ref, $conversion_ref )

=over

B<Definition:> This method is the gate keeper to the recursive parsing of 
Data::Walk::Extracted.  This method ensures that the minimum requirements for the recursive 
data parser are met.  If needed it will use a conversion ref (also provided by the caller) to 
change input hash keys to the generic hash keys used by this class.  This function then 
calls the actual recursive function.  For an overview of the recursive steps see the 
L<flow outline|/Recursive Parsing Flow>.

B<Accepts:> ( $passed_ref, $conversion_ref )

=over 

B<$passed_ref> this ref contains key value pairs as follows;

=over

B<primary_ref> - a dataref that the walker will walk - required

=over

review the $conversion_ref functionality in this function for renaming of this key.

=back

B<secondary_ref> - a dataref that is used for comparision while walking. - optional 

=over

review the $conversion_ref functionality in this function for renaming of this key.

=back

B<before_method> - a method name that will perform some action at the beginning 
of each node - optional

B<after_method> - a method name that will perform some action at the end 
of each node - optional

B<[attribute name]> - L<supported|/Supported one shot attributes> attribute names are 
accepted with temporary attribute settings here.  These settings are temporarily set for 
a single "_process_the_data" call and then the original attribute values are restored.  

=back

B<$conversion_ref> This allows a public method to accept different key names for the 
various keys listed above and then convert them later to the generic terms used by this class. 
- optional

B<Example>

	$passed_ref ={
		print_ref =>{ 
			First_key => [
				'first_value',
				'second_value'
			],
		},
		match_ref =>{
			First_key 	=> 'second_value',
		},
		before_method	=> '_print_before_method',
		after_method	=> '_print_after_method',
		sorted_nodes	=>{ Array => 1 },#One shot attribute setter
	}

	$conversion_ref ={
		primary_ref	=> 'print_ref',# generic_name => role_name,
		secondary_ref	=> 'match_ref',
	}

=back

B<Returns:> the $passed_ref (only) with the key names restored to the ones passed to this 
method using the $conversion_ref.

=back

=head3 _build_branch( $seed_ref, @arg_list )

=over

B<Definition:> There are times when a role will wish to reconstruct the data branch 
that lead from the 'zeroth' node to where the data walker is currently at.  This private 
method takes a seed reference and uses data found in the L<branch ref
|/A position trace is generated> to recursivly append to the front of the seed until a 
complete branch to the zeroth node is generated.  I<The branch_ref list must be 
explicitly passed.>

B<Accepts:> a list of arguments starting with the $seed_ref to build from.  
The remaining arguments are just the array elements of the 'branch ref'.

B<Example:>

	$ref = $self->_build_branch( 
		$seed_ref, 
		@{ $passed_ref->{branch_ref}},
	);

B<Returns:> a data reference with the current path back to the start pre-pended 
to the $seed_ref

=back

=head3 _extracted_ref_type( $test_ref )

=over

B<Definition:> In order to manage data types necessary for this class a data 
walker compliant 'Type' tester is provided.  This is necessary to support a few non 
perl-standard types not generated in standard perl typing systems.  First, 'undef' 
is the UNDEF type.  Second, strings and numbers both return as 'SCALAR' (not '' or undef).  
B<Much of the code in this package runs on dispatch tables that are built around these 
specific type definitions.>

B<Accepts:> It receives a $test_ref that can be undef.

B<Returns:> a data walker type or it confesses.

=back

=head3 _get_had_secondary

=over

B<Definition:> during the initial processing of data in 
L<_process_the_data|/_process_the_data( $passed_ref, $conversion_ref )> the existence 
of a passed secondary ref is tested and stored in the attribute '_had_secondary'.  On 
occasion a role might need to know if a secondary ref existed at any level if it it is 
not represented at the current level.

B<Accepts:> nothing

B<Returns:> True|1 if the secondary ref ever existed

=back

=head2 node

Each branch point of a data reference is considered a node.  The possible paths 
deeper into the data structure from the node are followed 'vertically first' in 
recursive parsing.  The original top level reference is considered the 'zeroth' 
node.

=head2 base node type

Recursion 'base' node L<types|/_extracted_ref_type( $test_ref )> are considered 
to not have any possible deeper branches.  Currently that list is SCALAR and UNDEF.

I<Other node support>

Support for Objects is partially implemented and as a consequence '_process_the_data' 
won't immediatly die when asked to parse an object.  It will still die but on a 
dispatch table call that indicates where there is missing object support, not at the 
top of the node.  This allows for some of the L<skip attributes|/skipped_nodes> to 
use 'OBJECT' in their definitions.

=head2 Dispatch Tables

This class uses the role L<Data::Walk::Extracted::Dispatch
|https://metacpan.org/module/Data::Walk::Extracted::Dispatch> to implement dispatch 
tables.  When there is a decision point, that role is used to make the class 
extensible.

=head1 Caveat utilitor

This is not an extention of L<Data::Walk|https://metacpan.org/module/Data::Walk>

The core class has no external effect.  All output comes from 
L<additions to the class|/Extending Data::Walk::Extracted>.

This module uses the 'L<defined or|http://perldoc.perl.org/perlop.html#Logical-Defined-Or>' 
(  //= ) and so requires perl 5.010 or higher.

This is a L<Moose|https://metacpan.org/module/Moose::Manual> based data handling class.  
Many coders will tell you Moose and data manipulation don't belong together.  They are 
most certainly right in speed intensive circumstances.

Recursive parsing is not a good fit for all data since very deep data structures will 
fill up a fair amount of memory!  Meaning that as the module recursively parses through 
the levels it leaves behind snapshots of the previous level that allow it to keep 
track of it's location.

The passed data references are effectivly deep cloned during this process.  To leave 
the primary_ref pointer intact see L<fixed_primary|/fixed_primary>

=head1 GLOBAL VARIABLES

=over

B<$ENV{Smart_Comments}>

The module uses L<Smart::Comments|https://metacpan.org/module/Smart::Comments> if the '-ENV' 
option is set.  The 'use' is encapsulated in an if block triggered by an environmental 
variable to comfort non-believers.  Setting the variable $ENV{Smart_Comments} in a BEGIN 
block will load and turn on smart comment reporting.  There are three levels of 'Smartness' 
available in this module '###',  '####', and '#####'.
